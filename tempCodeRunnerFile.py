'''The current implementation of the GUI prompts the user to provide a partial assignment for all variables in the polynomial. This is because the restricted polynomial is computed based on the values assigned to all variables in the partial assignment, not just a subset of them. If you only provide a partial assignment for some variables, the computed restricted polynomial may not be correct.'''
'''In the context of multilinear polynomials, a partial assignment is a set of variable-value pairs that assigns a specific value (either 0 or 1) to a subset of variables in the polynomial. The partial assignment allows us to restrict the polynomial by fixing the values of some variables to a specific value, while leaving the other variables free to take either value.

For example, if we have the polynomial x1x2 + x2x3 + x1x3x4 and a partial assignment of x1 = 1 and x4 = 0, then we can restrict the polynomial by fixing the values of x1 and x4 to their assigned values, resulting in the restricted polynomial x2 + x2x3 + x3.'''
